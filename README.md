# 🛍️ E-Commerce Web Project

Welcome to **Shopsmart**, a sleek, responsive, and modern e-commerce front-end built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created as part of a web development internship assignment to demonstrate UI/UX skills, JavaScript interactivity, and responsive design.

## 💡 How It Works

1. Products are dynamically rendered using JavaScript.
2. Adding an item stores it in localStorage as a cart array.
3. Cart page reads from localStorage and displays items in a styled layout.
4. A custom modal appears confirming the item was added — replacing the default alert.
